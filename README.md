# Overview

A micro-analysis that looked into the possible causes of land surface elevation changes captured by satellites (InSAR) in northern Ontario from 2016-2022.

### Scripts
1. 01-NRL_precip: primarily looks at 2016-2024 precipitation data from two weathercan stations (Lansdowne House and Ogoki Post A).
2. 02-NRL_sf: Combines the InSAR data with local precipitation from 01_NRL_precip and the annual discharge of the Attawapiskat River using tidyhydat into informative plots.
